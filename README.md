My project will be called Find An Expert. This is a resource where jobs can search for
employees viewing their profiles instead of employees hunting for companies to get on
board with. Similar to linked in, however this also adds personal info a bit more.
With linked in it's all business all of the time and you look through a persons info,
see what they've done and maybe it matches up with what 1,000,000 other people have done. Find an Expert will differentiate by allowing users to speak on their life experiences and what they've done and what they would like to achieve. Hobbies, interests, schooling, knowledge, desires to learn, everything that the interview process is used for to figure out. Nobody likes interviewing and this may help to make that process a little easier on both ends.

<h2>MVP</h2>
In the upcoming week I know that I can create the MVP of a website that creates users, logs their info, gives them a profile, and displays them in the three languages they're most comfortable with. This will be the simplest form of the website

Stretch goals: 
1) adding linked in to their profiles which I have already found the authorization walk through so I believe I can do it but I also have never done it before myself.
2) Get the Github API? Maybe to upload all projects which might actually make it easier when dividing by language because Github already has tech that does exactly that. Look into it, if not figured out in a timely manner off the table till further notice. 
<br> 

2) Scaling based off projects completed per language<br>

3) Adding UX design section for designers looking to get their names out<br>

4) Allowing companies to sign up and be reached out to <br>

5) Confirmation emails upon sign up <br>

6) Email button if company is interested <br>

7) Possibly a chat ability?? or just add email to reach out to about opportunities<br>

Questions:

I am thinking of using api's from LinkedIn and/or Google and maybe using it for login, do you think that is possible? Curious if I would need some sort of security guarantee or they have their own security when calling for info.
